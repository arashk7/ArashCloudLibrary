I had a short collaboration with ShineTech company which was about recording a 3D movie by using multiple rangefinder cameras. 
as a pioneer of this kind of technologies, we can mention Microsoft 3D movies and you can find many clips about their project on youtube.
all in all this collaboration made me start a project about reaching their technology in the basics level. ACL right now is able to do some basics with as easy as possible function and API. meanwhile, PCL is a leading library in this project and has the ability to process a point clouds in many ways, but in ACL we just used some of the functions which cover our needs.
ACL is a small library to work with PCL as convenient as possible.
Its main concentration is how to match a couple of different point clouds into the main point cloud and also real-time meshing.
